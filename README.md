<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of **collabeeration** is to is to provide the tools and
resources for craft brewers to analyze their data and make informed
decisions from a quality control perspective. We look forward to
collaborating with our fellow brewers to develop tools that can help our
community understand data and improve quality standards. We hope that
this effort will bring us closer to standardized data collection methods
and analysis. Cheers\!

## Installation

This package is currently mashing, and therefore not on CRAN yet. We are
still adding functions and updating documentation, so we donâ€™t recommend
drinking just yet.

However, follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CraftBeerSci) and we
will keep you in the loop\!
