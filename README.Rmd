<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of **collabeeration** is to is to provide the tools and resources for craft brewers to analyze their data and make informed decisions from a quality control perspective. We look forward to collaborating with our fellow brewers to develop tools that can help our community understand data and improve quality standards. We hope that this effort will bring us closer to standardized data collection methods and analysis. Cheers!

## Installation

This package is currently mashing, and therefore not on CRAN yet. We are still adding functions and updating documentation, so we don't recommend drinking just yet.

However, follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CraftBeerSci) and we will keep you in the loop!
